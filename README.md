 Mad Libs word game in java

 Java Variables: Mad Libs

In this project, I use Java to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blanks that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or weird).

Mad Libs require:

A short story with blanks (asking for different types of words).
Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

Java Basic Course Project. Module: Variables.

Objectives: Create all the variables needed for the story;
Print the story with the variables in the right places.
